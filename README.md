Breast cancer, a widespread health challenge, necessitates advanced diagnostic approaches for early detection and personalized treatment. In this project, machine learning algorithms, including K-nearest neighbors (K-NN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, converge to enhance breast cancer diagnosis. Leveraging the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset from the University of Wisconsin Hospital, our multidimensional initiative integrates diverse machine learning models for comprehensive insights into this complex health concern.
